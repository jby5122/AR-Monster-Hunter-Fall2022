# AR-Monster-Hunter-Fall2022
The final project for Wearable Class at NYU IDM. 

It’s all hunter’s dream to be in this beautiful world one day to experience the hunting beyond game consoles and keyboard. This is the final project for my Wearable Class at NYU IDM. It was fun to develop this wearable so we can experience more immersively in this amazing mh world. Let’s go hunters!!!

Camera angle control by head movement, avatar movement on the left hand, attack in the right hand, use item in the pocket, collect items outside of the pocket. 

Iteration in progress…
